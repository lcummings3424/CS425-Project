This project uses [render](https://dashboard.render.com/) to host the database. The program connects to the database which is already populated with the sample data. You do not need to run the "add_sample_data.py" file, since the sample data has already been added it will just cause errors.

The executable is located in \dist as well as the release.

The executable is standalone.
