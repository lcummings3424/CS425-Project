# CS425-Project

This project uses [render](https://dashboard.render.com/) to host the database. The program connects to the database which is already populated with the sample data. You do not need to run the "add_sample_data.py" file, since the sample data has already been added it will just cause errors. 

The executable is located in \dist\education_platform.

The executable will not work if it is not in the same folder as all files contained in \dist\education_platform (i.e. must be kept in the same structure as it is in the repository).
