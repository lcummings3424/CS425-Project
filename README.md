# CS425-Project

This project makes a few assumptions:

- You have postgresql installed on your system
- You have the admin username set up as "postgres"
- You have the admin passwoed set up as "posgres"
- You have the Schema.sql file hosted on your system (localhost) with the name "Education Platform". On my system, i use [Postbird](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird) for importing the sql file and setting up the database
- You have run "add_sample_data.py"
- The database is hosted on port 5432

It will not work if these items have not been completed (in that order)
If all of this has been completed, you can launch the executable located in \dist\education_platform
