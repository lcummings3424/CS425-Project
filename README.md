# CS425-Project

This project makes a few assumptions:

- you have postgresql installed on your system
- you have the admin username set up as "postgres"
- you have the admin passwoed set up as "posgres"
- you have the Schema.sql file hosted on your system with the name "Education Platform"
- you have run "add_sample_data.py"
It will not work if these items have not been completed (in that order)
If all of this has been completed, you can launch the executable located in \dist\education_platform
